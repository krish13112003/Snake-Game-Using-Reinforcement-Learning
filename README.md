# Snake-Game-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This repository features a Python-based Snake game, incorporating reinforcement learning with Deep Q-Learning. It includes a human-playable version and an AI agent that learns to play autonomously. The project uses Pygame for game development and PyTorch for the neural network powering the agent, offering a fun and educational experience in AI.
