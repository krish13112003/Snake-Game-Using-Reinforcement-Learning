# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a classic Snake game built using Python and Pygame, enhanced with reinforcement learning (RL) to create an AI agent that learns to play the game autonomously. The agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning, and the model is built using PyTorch.

The project also includes a human-playable version of the game to demonstrate the environment where the AI learns.

## Features

- **Human-playable version:** Play the Snake game manually.
- **Reinforcement Learning agent:** Watch the AI learn to play Snake using Q-Learning.
- **Neural Network:** The RL agent is powered by a deep neural network.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Train the agent and evaluate its performance over time.
